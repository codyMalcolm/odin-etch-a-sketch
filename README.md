# Etch-a-Sketch

## Objective

To create a virtual "Etch-a-sketch" where when the user passes the mouse through a div, the div gets colored and remains colored until the grid is reset.

#### Specifications

##### Main

1. Project should utilize Git and GitHub.
2. The webpage should be initialized with a 16x16 square grid of divs, created in Javascript
3. Divs should change color on mouseover, and remain changed.
4. There should be a button at the top of the screen to clear the current grid and prompt the user for the number of squares per side in a new grid. New grids should occupy the same total space, even if the number of squares is different.

##### Recommended

1. The grid of divs should go in a container.

##### Optional

1. Instead of changing every square to the same color, change them to random values.
2. Instead of the above, have each pass increment the fixed color by 10%, requiring 10 passes to completely darken.

##### Ambiguous

Nothing, so far...

#### Learning Objectives

To demonstrate mastery of manipulating DOM elements with Javascript.

## Author's Notes

#### Preliminary Thoughts

I'm going to implement both optional functionalities in parallel to the basic requirements, and the user can select their preference to reset a new grid. There may not be any new concepts for me in this project, but it will be a good exercise in architecture.

#### Final Thoughts

To be filled out upon completion.
